# Steps
# 1. Compare first element in each list and append smaller element
# 2. Using two indices and an iterator to perform same comparison for 
#  for all elements in both lists
# 3. Move marker up by 1 position when the smaller number is found
# 4. Copy remaining lists once comparisons are completed and there 
# are items still remaining in one a the lists
